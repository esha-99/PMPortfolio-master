                                        <div class="titleStep"><span>Day 1</span></div>
                                        <p> 1. Twenty-four hours before serving, start the détrempe: In the bowl of
                                            a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the flour, sugar, salt
                                            and yeast, and stir to combine. Create a well in the center, and pour in
                                            the water and milk. Mix on low speed until a tight, smooth dough comes
                                            together around the hook, about 5 minutes. Remove the hook and cover the
                                            bowl with a damp towel. Set aside for 10 minutes.</p>
                                        <p> 2. Reattach the dough hook and turn the mixer on medium-low speed. Add
                                            the butter pieces all at once and continue to mix, scraping down the
                                            bowl and hook once or twice, until the dough has formed a very smooth,
                                            stretchy ball that is not the least bit sticky, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>
                                        <p> 3. Form the dough into a ball and place seam-side down on a lightly
                                            floured work surface. Using a sharp knife, cut two deep perpendicular
                                            slashes in the dough, forming a “+.” (This will help the dough expand
                                            into a square shape as it rises, making it easier to roll out later.)
                                            Place the dough slashed-side up inside the same mixing bowl, cover with
                                            plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until about 1 1/2 times
                                            its original size, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer the bowl to the
                                            refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours and up to 12.</p>

                                        <div class="titleStep"><span>Day 2</span></div>
                                        <p>1. As the dough chills, make the butter block: Place the sticks of butter
                                            side-by-side in the center of a large sheet of parchment paper, then
                                            loosely fold all four sides of the parchment over the butter to form a
                                            packet. Turn the packet over and use a rolling pin to lightly beat the
                                            cold butter into a flat scant 1/2-inch-thick layer, fusing the sticks
                                            and making it pliable. (Don’t worry about the shape at this point.) The
                                            parchment may tear. Turn over the packet and unwrap, replacing the
                                            parchment with a new sheet if needed. Fold the parchment paper over the
                                            butter again, this time making neat, clean folds at right angles (like
                                            you’re wrapping a present), forming an 8-inch square. Turn the packet
                                            over again and roll the pin across the packet, further flattening the
                                            butter into a thin layer that fills the entire packet while forcing out
                                            any air pockets. The goal is a level and straight-edged square of
                                            butter. Transfer the butter block to the refrigerator.</p>
                                        <p> 2. Eighteen hours before serving, remove the dough from the
                                            refrigerator, uncover and transfer to a clean work surface. (It will
                                            have doubled in size.) Deflate the dough with the heel of your hand.
                                            Using the four points that formed where you slashed the dough, stretch
                                            the dough outward and flatten into a rough square measuring no more than
                                            8 inches on one side.</p>
                                        <p> 3. Place 2 pieces of plastic wrap on the work surface perpendicular to
                                            each other, and place the dough on top. Wrap the dough rectangle,
                                            maintaining the squared-off edges, then roll your pin over top as you
                                            did for the butter, forcing the dough to fill in the plastic and form an
                                            8-inch square with straight sides and right angles. Freeze for 20
                                            minutes.</p>
                                        <p> 4. Remove the butter from the refrigerator and the dough from the
                                            freezer. Set aside the butter. Unwrap the dough (save the plastic, as
                                            you’ll use it again) and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll the
                                            dough, dusting with flour if necessary, until 16 inches long,
                                            maintaining a width of 8 inches (barely wider than the butter block).
                                            With a pastry brush, brush off any flour from the surface of the dough
                                            and make sure none sticks to the surface.</p>
                                        <p> 5. You’re going to enclose the butter block in the dough and roll them
                                            out together. To ensure they do so evenly, they should have the same
                                            firmness, with the dough being slightly colder than the butter. The
                                            butter should be chilled but able to bend without breaking. If it feels
                                            stiff or brittle, let sit at room temperature for a few minutes. Unwrap
                                            the butter just so the top is exposed, then use the parchment paper to
                                            carefully invert the block in the center of the dough rectangle,
                                            ensuring all sides are parallel. Press the butter gently into the dough
                                            and peel off the parchment paper. You should have a block of butter with
                                            overhanging dough on two opposite sides and a thin border of dough along
                                            the other two.</p>
                                        <p> 6. Grasp the overhanging dough on one side and bring it over the butter
                                            toward the center, then repeat with the other side of the dough,
                                            enclosing the butter. You don’t need the dough to overlap, but you want
                                            the two sides to meet, so stretch it if necessary, and pinch the dough
                                            together along all seams so no butter peeks out anywhere. Lift the whole
                                            block and dust a bit of flour underneath, then rotate the dough 90
                                            degrees, so the center seam is oriented vertically.</p>
                                        <p> 7. Orient the rolling pin perpendicular to the seam and lightly beat the
                                            dough all along the surface to lengthen and flatten. Roll out the dough
                                            lengthwise along the seam into a 24-inch-long, 1/4-inch-thick narrow
                                            slab, lightly dusting underneath and over top with more flour as needed
                                            to prevent sticking. Rather than applying pressure downward, try to push
                                            the dough toward and away from you with the pin, which will help
                                            maintain even layers of dough and butter. Remember to periodically lift
                                            the dough and make sure it’s not sticking to the surface, and try your
                                            best to maintain straight, parallel sides. (It’s OK if the shorter sides
                                            round a bit — you’re going to trim them.)</p>
                                        <p> 8. Use a wheel cutter or long, sharp knife to trim the shorter ends,
                                            removing excess dough where the butter doesn’t fully extend and squaring
                                            off the corners for a very straight-edged, even rectangle of dough.
                                            Maintaining the rectangular shape, especially at this stage, will lead
                                            to the most consistent and even lamination. If at any point in the
                                            process you see air bubbles in the dough while rolling, pierce them with
                                            a cake tester or the tip of a paring knife to deflate and proceed.</p>
                                        <p> 9. Dust any flour off the dough’s surface. Grasp the short side of the
                                            rectangle farther from you and fold it toward the midline of the dough
                                            slab, aligning the sides. Press gently so the dough adheres to itself.
                                            Repeat with the other side of the dough, leaving an 1/8-inch gap where
                                            the ends meet in the middle. Now, fold the entire slab in half crosswise
                                            along the gap in the center. You should now have a rectangular packet of
                                            dough, called a “book,” that’s four layers thick. This is a “double
                                            turn,” and it has now quadrupled the number of layers of butter inside
                                            the dough.</p>
                                        <p> 10. Wrap the book tightly in the reserved plastic. If it is thicker than
                                            about 1 1/2 inches, or if it’s lost some of its rectangularity, roll
                                            over the plastic-wrapped dough to flatten it and reshape it. Freeze the
                                            book for 15 minutes, then refrigerate for 1 hour.</p>
                                        <p> 11. Let the dough sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes. Unwrap
                                            and place on a lightly floured surface. Beat the dough and roll out as
                                            before (Step 10) into another long, narrow 3/8-inch-thick slab. It
                                            should be nice and relaxed, and extend easily. Dust off any excess
                                            flour.</p>
                                        <p>12. Fold the dough in thirds like a letter, bringing the top third of the
                                            slab down and over the center third, then the bottom third up and over.
                                            This is a “simple turn,” tripling the layers. Press gently so the layers
                                            adhere. Wrap tightly in plastic again and freeze for 15 minutes, then
                                            refrigerate for 1 hour.</p>
                                        <p> 13. Let the dough sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes, then
                                            unwrap and place on a lightly floured surface. Beat the dough and roll
                                            out as before, but into a 14-by-17-inch slab (15-by-16-inch for pain au
                                            chocolat or ham and cheese croissants). The dough will start to spring
                                            back, but try to get it as close to those dimensions as possible. Brush
                                            off any excess flour, wrap tightly in plastic, and slide onto a baking
                                            sheet or cutting board. Freeze for 20 minutes, then chill overnight (8
                                            to 12 hours). If making pain au chocolat or ham and cheese croissants,
                                            see recipes.</p>
                                        <p> 14. Four and a half hours before serving, arrange racks in the upper and
                                            lower thirds of the oven. Bring a skillet of water to a simmer over
                                            medium-high heat. Transfer the skillet to the floor of the oven and
                                            close the door. (The steam released inside the oven will create an ideal
                                            proofing environment.)</p>
                                        <p> 15. As the steam releases in the oven, line two rimmed baking sheets
                                            with parchment paper and set aside. Let the dough sit at room
                                            temperature for about 5 minutes. Unwrap (save the plastic for proofing),
                                            place on a very lightly floured surface, and, if necessary, roll out to
                                            17-by-14 inches. Very thoroughly dust off any excess flour with a pastry
                                            brush. Use a wheel cutter or long knife and ruler to cut the shorter
                                            sides, trimming any irregular edges where not all the layers of dough
                                            fully extend and creating a rectangle that’s exactly 16 inches long,
                                            then cut into four 4-by-14-inch rectangles.</p>
                                        <p> 16. Separate the rectangles, then use the ruler and wheel cutter to
                                            slice a straight line from opposite corners of one rectangle to form two
                                            long, equal triangles. Repeat with the remaining rectangles to make 8
                                            triangles. Trim the short side of each triangle at a slight angle,
                                            making them into triangles with longer sides of equal length.</p>
                                        <p> 17. Working one triangle at a time, grasp the two corners of the shorter
                                            end, the base of the crescent, and tug gently outward to extend the
                                            points and widen the base to about 3 inches. Then, gently tug outward
                                            from about halfway down the triangle all the way to the point, to both
                                            lengthen the triangle and thin the dough as it narrows. Starting at the
                                            base (the short end), snugly roll up the dough, keeping the point
                                            centered and applying light pressure. Try not to roll tightly or stretch
                                            the dough around itself. Place the crescent on one of the
                                            parchment-lined baking sheets, resting it on the point of the triangle.
                                            If the dough gets too soft while you’re working, cover the triangles and
                                            freeze for a few minutes before resuming rolling. Space them evenly on
                                            the baking sheets, four per sheet. Very loosely cover the baking sheets
                                            with plastic wrap, so the croissants have some room to expand.</p>
                                        <p>18. Three and a half hours before serving, open the oven and stick your
                                            hand inside: It should be humid but not hot, as the water in the skillet
                                            will have cooled. You want the croissants to proof at 70 to 75 degrees.
                                            (Any hotter and the butter will start to melt, leading to a denser
                                            croissant.) Place the baking sheets inside the oven and let the
                                            croissants proof until they’re about doubled in size, extremely puffy,
                                            and jiggle delicately when the baking sheet is gently shaken, 2 to 2 1/2
                                            hours. Resist the urge to touch or poke the croissants as they proof:
                                            They’re very delicate. Try not to rush this process, either, as an
                                            underproofed croissant will not be as light and ethereal.</p>
                                        <p>19. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and carefully uncover them,
                                            then transfer to the refrigerator and chill for 20 minutes while you
                                            heat the oven. Remove the skillet from the oven and heat to 375 degrees.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> 20. In a small bowl, stir the yolk and heavy cream until streak-free.
                                            Using a pastry brush, gently brush the smooth surfaces of each crescent
                                            with the yolk and cream mixture, doing your best to avoid the cut sides
                                            with exposed layers of dough.</p>
                                        <p> 21. Transfer the sheets to the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Rotate the
                                            baking sheets and switch racks, and continue to bake until the
                                            croissants are deeply browned, another 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the
                                            oven and let cool completely on the baking sheets.</p>
